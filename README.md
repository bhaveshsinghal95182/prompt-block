# Introduction
This project was made using [lovable](https://lovable.dev). I made this project to help me with creating scripts but it can be used in other ways as well such as creating a prompt for any other use.

# Idea: 
Instead of typing out the whole prompt in one go I needed a tool to help me with creating a prompt divided into smaller prompts. [Prompt Block](https://prompt-block.vercel.app/)

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhaveshsinghal95182/prompt-block.git
